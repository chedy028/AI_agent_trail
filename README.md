# AI Agent Implementation Project

This project implements AI agents following Anthropic's principles and patterns for building effective agents. The implementation explores various agent patterns and workflows using OpenAI's API.

## Project Structure 

## Features

- **Basic Text Generation**: Implementation of augmented LLM capabilities using OpenAI's API
- **Router Pattern**: Intelligent routing of tasks to specialized handlers
- **Parallelization**: Implementation of parallel processing patterns for AI tasks
- **Environment Management**: Secure API key handling using environment variables

## Implementation Patterns

Following Anthropic's guidelines, this project implements several key patterns:

1. **Augmented LLM**: Basic building block with enhanced capabilities
2. **Router Workflow**: Classification and direction of inputs to specialized tasks
3. **Parallelization Workflow**: Parallel processing of subtasks for improved efficiency

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: 

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file
   - Add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Security Note

- The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to protect sensitive API keys
- Never commit API keys or sensitive credentials to version control
